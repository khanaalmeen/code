# [Project 1- Advertising Sales Prediction using ML regression algorithm](https://github.com/khanaalmeen/code/blob/main/LINEAR_REGRESSION.ipynb)   
* The dataset (https://github.com/khanaalmeen/code/blob/main/Advertising%20(1).csv) consists of advertising expenditure incurred on different mediums and the overall increase in revenue that was seen during that time. For any business, advertising their products is very essential because it aids in the fast selling of a product, increases the popularity and awareness of the product in the market, which in turn, increases the overall sales for the product. But more than that, what matters for the business is that the correct amount of investment should be done upon the advertisements such that it generates good return on investments otherwise it will just lead to an added expenditure.
* The dataset contains statistics about the increase in sales of a product in 200 different months, together with advertising budgets in each of these months for different media channels: TV, radio and newspaper. The budget and the increase in sales is in thousands of dollars. 
* I have implemented a regression technique and predicted what would be the increase in sales given the advertisement expenditure for that month.
* Used Ridge, lasso regression to determine R2,Adjusted R2 and RMSE of the model.


# [Project 2 - Customer Segmentation using K means clustering](https://github.com/khanaalmeen/code/blob/main/kmeans%20Clustering%20-Mall%20customer%20Segmentation.ipynb)
* The given dataset() was gathered through a feedback survey and the spending score was calculated on the basis of several factors like how often does the customer visit the mall, how much of amount does he spend on shopping and also on entertainment and food. Based on this,a good spending score which is close to 100 indicates a good customer and spending score close to 1 indicates a bad customer. 
* Applied K-means clustering algorithm to find out the potential customers to roll out special offer to them.
* Outcome is to find out the optimum number of segments that can be generated, segment the customers and help the company with the potential customers.
